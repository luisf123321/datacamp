Tracking crime statistics
Sergeant Laura wants to do some background research to help her better understand 
the cultural context for Bayes' kidnapping. She has plotted Burglary rates in three U.S. 
cities using data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics.

She wants to present this data to her officers, and she wants the image to be as 
beautiful as possible to effectively tell her data story.

Recall:

You can change linestyle to dotted (':'), dashed('--'), or no line ('').
You can change the marker to circle ('o'), diamond('d'), or square ('s').

# Change the color of Phoenix to `"DarkCyan"`
plt.plot(data["Year"], data["Phoenix Police Dept"], label="Phoenix", color="DarkCyan")

# Make the Los Angeles line dotted
plt.plot(data["Year"], data["Los Angeles Police Dept"], label="Los Angeles", linestyle = ":")

# Add square markers to Philedelphia
plt.plot(data["Year"], data["Philadelphia Police Dept"], label="Philadelphia", marker = "s")

# Add a legend
plt.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()

"""
Playing with styles
Help Sergeant Laura try out a few different style options. Changing the plotting style is a fast way to change the entire look of your plot without having to update individual colors or line styles. Some popular styles include:

'fivethirtyeight' - Based on the color scheme of the popular website
'grayscale' - Great for when you don't have a color printer!
'seaborn' - Based on another Python visualization library
'classic' - The default color scheme for Matplotlib
"""

# Change the style to fivethirtyeight
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

# Plot lines
plt.plot(data["Year"], data["Phoenix Police Dept"], label="Phoenix")
plt.plot(data["Year"], data["Los Angeles Police Dept"], label="Los Angeles")
plt.plot(data["Year"], data["Philadelphia Police Dept"], label="Philadelphia")

# Add a legend

Identifying Bayes' kidnapper
We've narrowed the possible kidnappers down to two suspects:

Fred Frequentist (suspect1)
Gertrude Cox (suspect2)
The kidnapper left a long ransom note containing several unusual phrases. 
Help DataCamp by using a line plot to compare the frequency of letters in the ransom 
note to samples from the two main suspects.

Three DataFrames have been loaded:

ransom contains the letter frequencies for the ransom note.
suspect1 contains the letter frequencies for the sample from Fred Frequentist.
suspect2 contains the letter frequencies for the sample from Gertrude Cox.
Each DataFrame contain two columns letter and frequency.

         # Plot the ransom letter as a dotted gray line
